# MovieManiac Android app.
This is an android application built using **Jetpack Compose** (New Android UI Toolkit), and this [design](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/movie-streaming-app-50ff66cf-74f6-4a1f-94b7-3c95bbdc44c7) from UpLabs. 

Also I use YTS Movie API to get list of movies, to view details for particular movie and to download movie 

This Application is for learning purpose


## Usage
In order to download movie from Movie Maniac you will first need to have Torrent client like like uTorrent/FreeDownloadManger installed in your device.

## Heads Up
No tests included yet in the application because I am currently learning Testing in Android. Will iclude tests in the future.
